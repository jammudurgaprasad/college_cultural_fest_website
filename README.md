# college_cultural_fest_website
ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project for the web development competition: Colorido 2k25! ðŸŽ¨ðŸŒŸ

I designed and developed a dynamic website for our college's cultural fest using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The site features a smooth scroll navigation with sections for About College, Events, Hospitality, Transportation, and Contact Us. 
Plus, we've included a streamlined registration form to sign up for events easily.

Proud of how it turned out and eager for feedback! Check it out and let me know what you think.
